# **Analysis of AirBnB Listing using PySpark**
In this project I investigate the AirBnB public database to collect findings of listings and prices in various cities around the world. Furthermore the repository uses Apache Spark functions for Python due to the volume of data available.

#Use Case

- Use Case Summary
- Objective Statement:
  * Get business insights about listing prices about short term rental in AirBnB.
  * Introduce how to handle big data using distributed computing for data processing.
  * Analyze customer reviews using sentiment analysis to understand what are the factors of satisfaction for a good stay.
  * Understand the bottlenecks through customer reviews and take action on which property types and regions are most affected by them.
  
- Challenges:
  * Large volume of data, not possible to process in traditional ways (spreedsheet, csv, etc...).
  * The prices of the stays vary a lot due to several factors (location, exclusivity, quality, reviews etc...).
  
- Methodology / Analytic Technique:
  * Descriptive analysis
  * Graph analysis
  * Sentiment analysis
  
- Business Benefit:
  * Highlight the important factors for maintaining the quality of service provided in the AirBnB application.

- Expected Outcome:
  * Understand which are the most expensive cities to rent a property in AirBnB.
  * Know what are the most rated terms for positive and negative reviews.
  * Which property types are most desired by users and which regions are the most cost-effective.
  
# Business Understanding

- Short term rental was a revolution in the so-called sharing economy in the silicon valley startup boom. Private landlords have the option to rent out their own properties to registered users on the AirBnB platform, so this project has some questions to answer using the data:
- Which neighborhoods have the highest listings in the most popular cities?
- What are the most expensive regions to rent an AirBnB?
- Which cities are the most cost-effective (average rating/average price of stay)?
- What are the busiest months in property listings?
- What are the most used criteria to evaluate a property on AirBnB?
